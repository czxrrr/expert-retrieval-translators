\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}
The subjects which are studied during design of the framework can be classified into two main topics. First aggregating results of similarity between query document and previous translated documents in order to estimate expert's proficiency. Second applying a learning to rank method to find and offer the best experts.

\subsection{Aggregation Functions}
In order to calculate experience of expert related to client's document, we need to figure out the similarity between query document and all previous-translated documents. 

***TODO: Introducing aggregation methods and choosing one for the framework ***
%The similarity is calculated by Lucene library and is denoted as $SIM$ function. Every pre-translated document is assessed by corrector's feedback ($f'$). In additional to these documents, every translator may submit some other documents which had been translated before and clearly not assessed. In the framework, we assume their quality as medium (two). In the following formula $d_iterator$ and $d_q$ stand for pre-translated and query documents. $n$ and $m$ are the number of pre-translated document inside and outside the framework.


\subsection{Learning To Rank}
***TODO: Ranking methods goes here. Comparing between Point-wise, Pair-wise and List-wise and choosing the most related one for the framework ***
